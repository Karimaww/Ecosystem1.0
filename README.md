# Ecosystem
 Simulation with preys and predators in discrete world
 
 This ecosystem will contain two types of virtual entities: preys and predators, likely to eat the latter. 
 The ecosystem is a discrete world (a torus, which we will display as a rectangle) containing a number of boxes, identified by their (integer) x and y coordinates.
 Each prey (and each predator) is in a given box and can move. At a given time, a box can contain several preys and several predators. Each box can also contain grass, food for prey.
